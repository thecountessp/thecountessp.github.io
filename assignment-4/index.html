            IAR [Irish Alternative Radio] is a new app that combines the best of traditional, lovingly made,
            human-centred radio and the
            convenience of smart devices and always on connectivity.
          </p><br>
          <h5>Listeners</h5>
          Create an account, select your favourite genres of music and we'll populate a 24/7 schedule of Irish radio
          programmes from Community, Digital, Commercial and National broadcasters. No live show that fits your
          criteria? We'll pull from previously broacast shows via RSS and Cloudcast hosts, so there's always
          something fresh for your ears.
          </p><br>
          <h5>Creators</h5>
          Create an account, populate your profile and start adding shows to the back-end scheduler. You can add
          conctact information, listen back RSS and logos. Add your root streaming url, and you're ready to reach
          new
          listeners. That's it!

          be TuneIn or Spotify. It has a specific target audience of Irish music lovers that want to discover new
          content and support Irish producers. This may only be 200,000 people, but they are likely to be loyal,
          interested, media-savvy and willing to try new things.</p><br>

              <p>This product offers a bespoke, user-tailored audio feed of live, human-made FM and digital radio. You
                can listen through the mobile application, mobile website or desktop and you can also listen across
                smart devices in the home or while travelling. Irish Alternative Radio is the first player in Ireland to
                champion the excellent and overlooked niche and specialist radio shows made each week by staff and
                volunteers of state, commercial, local, community and digital stations. It is designed to run in the
                background and keep the listener company, but do so with local presenters, producers, content, news,
                artists and musicians. The schedule is “set it and forget” unless users want to make changes to their
                stream feed. </p>

              <p>The primary function of the app is to play a continuous online stream of Irish-produced audio, tailored
                to the user. There is an initial setup with basic data and genre choces. On a granular level, users can
                mute shows and stations, star favourite shows, share shows and schedules and email the stations or
                presenters through their schedule page on the app. In addition if metadata is available from the
                station, the user can ask the smart speaker what song is currently playing, ask Irish alternative radio
                to mute a show or star a show. In addition, users can receive a smartphone, desktop or smart speaker
                notification that a starred show is about to come on air.</p>

                class="bi bi-chevron-up icon-close"></i></div>
            <div id="faq4" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
              <p>The application needs continuous internet connectivity to run. Bandwidth requirements are not a high as
                video streaming. Radio stations offer their streams at bitrates ranging from 96 to 320kbps, already
                allowing for users listening in areas with poorer internet coverage or those in transit.
                The user databases are hosted on cloud servers. To listen online, or on a smart speaker the application
                needs to fetch user data in the form of schedule, current show and streaming url. In the case that there
                is no live show being broadcast that matches the user preferences for genre, there is a fallback list of
                RSS feeds in the database of previously cloud/podcasted shows in the user’s preferred genres that will
                be fetched and streamed until the next live show meeting the user criteria airs. In addition to this,
                there may be metadata embedded in each audio stream, but this is dependent on the encoding at each
                creator site.

                desktop, laptop, tablet or smart speaker. Each device needs to be connected to the internet and have a
                speaker or headphone output. In the case of the smart speaker, this also needs be conncted to the
                internet so that the “proprietary protocols of the OT network to the IT network” (Sinclair) can

                <h3>Irish Alternative Radio Application</h3><br>
                <figure>
                  <h4>Design and Visual Aspects</h4>
                  I have designed a high fidelity prototype (Nunes and Pratt 128) as the visual style of the product is
                  key to its usability, desirability, the sense of ownership for users and the idea of an alternative or
                  niche “club” of users. I used static invitations (Scott and Neil 181) as opposed to wizards, and
                  separated out user onboarding and preferences into a multi-page process (Scott and Neil 174) as the
                  app is aimed at a small screen, and each page has a separate area of focus, e.g. Privacy and
                  notifications or music genre selection.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I have designed the app as a multi-page mobile site. There are two distinct skins based on the kind of
                  user. It is important to separate out and distinguish between the requirements of “the listener” and
                  “the creator”.

                  <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>These two questions create a series of conditional states which we can then start to form some
                      ideas
                      on how to wireframe them. When wireframing this experience, this flow diagram can act as a guide
                      to
                      make sure each page or state has been captured.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
                    <cite title="Source Title">Cronenwett</cite>
                  </figcaption>

                  At the design stage I thought it wise to create two different user experiences, much as I had
                  previously seen on Film Freeway. That website had distinct visual and functional design feels for
                  festivals and creators. In this product once the user condition is set to listeners have a black
                  background with white text and all the appropriate controls for editing their schedule and
                  preferences. The creators have a white background with black text and extra functionality around
                  editing, adding and removing shows and show media.
                  <br>

                  Once I had developed the user personae and scenarios the wireframing was straightforward; put myself
                  in their shoes, ask what I would want, and attempt to deliver that. I had several iterations of the
                  wireframing, testing and refining until the product flowed satisfactorily.

                  I have identified TuneIn and Irish Radioplayer as direct competitors, one international and one
                  region-specific. Both are applications, the former a smart phone, smart speaker, smart TV and desktop
                  web application, the latter a mobile application and smart speaker skill with no desktop functionality
                  TuneIn is a freemium multipage applications with a huge number of platforms supported. Irish
                  Radioplayer, which is free, has only application and skill capabilities. My product would lie
                  somewhere in between, also free, and with mobile application, skill and desktop availability. Users
                  must be logged in to TuneIn to use all functionality, such as personalised lists. The same is true for
                  my product and the tailored user schedules. Irish Radioplayer is on request streaming of stations,
                  with favourite channels cached on the application. Login for TuneIn and IAR is via email or social
                  media.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  All applications are designed with a specific focus – simple that of finding the content you want and
                  streaming it with as little fuss as possible. There are no wizards or pop-ups needed, as the process
                  of searching and listening is uncomplicated. IAR however does guide the user from page to page during
                  initial setup.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  None of the apps have a customisable skin, all being focussed on audio and likely have the device put
                  into a pocket, talked to or distanced from while completing other tasks.
                  IAR is the only of the tree applications to have functionality around creation, and creators are
                  guided through this process on multiple pages with submission buttons on each page.
                  The unique selling points of Irish Alternative Radio are; its linking to all radio stations, not just
                  RTÉ and Independent Commercial Stations, high levels of customisability, understated design not common
                  in radio applications and websites and its levelling of the media play field.
